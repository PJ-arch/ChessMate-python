# ChessMate-python
This is the source-code of the Chess Mate python game i worked on years ago.

It's an UNFINISHED game which unfortuantely i didn't get enough time to work on it due to college and work.
But it's still has playable parts:
- open the play.bat file to play the game offline(it's a local 1v1 chess game)
- open the UI.bat to preview the UI menu of the game that i've been working on(it does nothing at all, just fake settings changing and playing)

I only upload this to show my skills and the way i write my codes, this is an old project though, so more i'll be posting online and show my improved skills. Stay tuned!
